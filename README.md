# release-notes-gen

## 🤔 What is this thing?

This is a little cli tool written in deno that generates release notes from jira tickets.
It is incomplete at this stage, but solved a problem I had.

## 🛣️ Roadmap:

- get args properly.
- add new format that generates a markdown file with each jira ticket summary grouped by type
- add new format that returns all data as an ascii table (https://deno.land/x/ascii_table@v0.1.0#usage)
